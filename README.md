# Grab sheet program
## Overview
This program was designed to help a local food delivery service to generate the grab sheet from raw data generated by the backend system.
The raw data consists of two files. The first file is "customer_order.xlsx", which contains the information of customers name and the meals they ordered. The other file is "customer_stop.xlsx", which contains the information of the delivery stop for each customer. Previously, admin of the business needs to create the output file manually every week, but with this program, the output file can be generated instantly.

The sample of the input/output files are shown in the repository. Sample of config file is also attached, but need to be edited on the local machine.

## Dependencies
The program requires some packages which can be installed through pip. All dependencies are listed in "requirements.txt"

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
